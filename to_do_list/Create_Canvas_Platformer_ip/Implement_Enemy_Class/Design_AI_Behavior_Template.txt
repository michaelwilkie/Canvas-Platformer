Come up with a generic design for how AI will behave.

Since this will be an on-board AI, all agents will be rule-based.
I can base it off half-life's schedule system.

List of actions:
    action A
    action B
    action C
    action D
    action E
    ...

List of states:
    State 1
    State 2
    State 3
    State 4
    State 5
    ...

Perceive-Think-Act loop:
The current state and percepts prompt the action
    actions are scheduled,
    and actions transition states.
