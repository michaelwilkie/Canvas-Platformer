Currently, the edit mode component has everything laid out it a single-array manner:

|  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |
|  10 |  11 |  12 |  13 |  14 |  15 |  16 |  17 |  18 |
|  19 |  20 |

But I want related tiles to be next to each other:


| 1 |           |  3  |
| 2 |      | 16 |  17 |  19 |
                |  5  |
